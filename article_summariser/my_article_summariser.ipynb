      "No project actually goes as planned, just last week something came up that influenced my scheduling and I had to adapt my timetable for just that week. Change occurs in all facets of other lives and how we manage it matters, because it influences the outcome of any project or task taken up.\n",

      "What is Change management ?\n",
      "\n",
      "This refers to using an approach and set of processes to effectively plan, implement and control changes within a project. It also involves management of people to achieve the desired outcomes and adopt it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Itâ€™s important to recognise that itâ€™s the people in an organisation who are directly impacted by any changes in the workplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "There several change management models and a few could be found in this links in the reference section.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter the model used some concepts are vital to change management which are;\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating a sense of ownership and urgency: Ownership and urgency enables team members to take responsibility towards the completion of their tasks and the importance it holds towards the progression of a project. When team members and stakeholders understands this, the progression of a project no matter the problems and hurdles met allow for an easy implementation of change management models.\n",

Effective communication : Choosing the right personnel is vital towards the project, but sometimes as the project manager, your team is selected for you which means not only your communication but soft skills would be highly needed to connect with each team member in order to keep the project running. Developing a comprehensive strategy for sharing information about the changes to all stakeholders and team members leads to transparency and openness amongst everyone.\n",

      "\n",
      "When: Change management should be integrated from the projectâ€™s initiation and continue throughout its lifecycle. It is crucial during major project milestones, shifts in project scope, or when adapting to external factors.\n",

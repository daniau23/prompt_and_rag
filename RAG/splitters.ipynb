methodology?\\n\\nHaving established that not all projects are the same, there is a need to have a predefined set of methods in place for the successful completion of a project.\\n\\nThis is where project management methodology comes in.\\n\\nProject management methodology is a set of guiding principles, techniques and processes used through a project’s life cycle.\\n\\nIt essentially guides project managers with knowing which framework works best for a given project at hand.\\n\\nProjects could be linear or iterative.\\n\\nLinear projects means a project is executed in a sequential order.\\n\\nExamples are; the construction of a house, Highway, pipeline and tunnels construction, these kind of projects benefits from the use of the Waterfall methodology as its dictates a linear approach in project execution.\\n\\nIt is also referred to as the waterfall cycle because the stages have a distinct progressive flow.', 'It is also referred to as the waterfall cycle because the stages have a distinct progressive flow.\\n\\nIterative projects permits more flexibility and change management.\\n\\nIt follows the repetition of phases thereby allowing parts of the project to be tested out to ensure correctness level is achieved before the final result is delivered.\\n\\nParts of the project can be delivered as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire project to be done.\\n\\nIt is also known as the agile cycle due to its ability to break down activities into short phases that derive value.\\n\\nOther project types are;\\n\\nHybrid\\n\\nIncremental\\n\\nEvolutionary\\n\\nThere several project methodologies and I would briefly discuss the following below, but please refer to the references for more methodologies;\\n\\nWaterfall: In the application of this approach, project managers connect each task to the previous one with a dependency.', 'This means that teams cannot proceed to the next phase of work until they have successfully addressed the tasks at hand.\\n\\nSuch a method encourages collaboration and ensures that the team remains focused on the current task.\\n\\nA project manager might opt for the Waterfall approach under the following circumstances:\\n\\nWhen implementing changes to the project becomes costly once initiated.\\n\\nWhen the project’s phases are well-defined from the outset.\\n\\nWhen there are prerequisite tasks that must be completed before progressing to the next stage.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nAgile: The Agile methodology stands out as one of the widely adopted project management frameworks, even surpassing the popularity of Waterfall.\\n\\nAgile is more than just a set of steps but a mindset.\\n\\nIts focus lies in cultivating an effective and collaborative team that actively seeks regular feedback from the client.\\n\\nAgile, in essence, is a philosophy centered around flexibility, client engagement, and continuous improvement.', 'Projects that are ideally suited for an Agile approach are;\\n\\nThose in which the client possesses a general idea of their requirements but lacks a precise vision or has a set of desired qualities without rigid specifications.\\n\\nWhen the emphasis is on adaptability and the acceptance of a certain level of uncertainty and risk\\n\\nIn scenarios where flexibility and responsiveness to evolving needs are crucial elements of project success.\\n\\nAn example of an Agile project is building a website.\\n\\nYour team would construct various components of the website in iterative sprints, delivering each part to the client as it is completed.\\n\\nThis enables the launch of the website with fully developed sections, such as the main homepage, ready for public viewing, while other features like the company blog or online appointment booking are continuously developed over time.', 'This iterative delivery model facilitates early feedback from the client, allowing for adjustments along the way and minimising wasted efforts.\\n\\nIt ensures that the website evolves organically, aligning with client preferences and requirements.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nScrum: This Agile framework prioritises the development, delivery, and long-term support of complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process.\\n\\nSmall, cross-functional teams, guided by a Scrum Master, handle the work, which is segmented into brief Sprints with predefined deliverables.\\n\\nOther project methodology can be found in the References\\n\\n💡 Activity 2: List other project management methodologies\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we were able to establish that not all projects are the same but all project do have a similar life cycle.', 'Moreover, we identified that projects could be linear or iterative and all projects would require a some form of framework(s) used for the successfully completion of the project.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle:The

Management?\\n\\nArticle:\\nWhat is Project Management?\\n\\nAn introduction to project management Daniel Chiebuka Ihenacho · Follow 4 min read · Nov 9, 2023 -- Listen Share\\n\\nPhoto by Octavian Dan on Unsplash\\n\\nWhat is a project?\\n\\nIn the realm of project management, a project is defined as a unique venture, characterised by its sets of deliverables and exclusive objectives.\\n\\nThis venture is a defined beginning and an end.', 'This venture is a defined beginning and an end.\\n\\nExamples of projects can be found in your daily lives or even your workplace;\\n\\nGrocery shopping within a defined timeframe\\n\\nPlanning your vacation\\n\\nPlanning a wedding ceremony\\n\\nOrganising a party/event\\n\\nCompletion of a university task\\n\\nPreparation for an examination to get a suitable score\\n\\nThese are just a few examples about a projects in our daily lives.\\n\\n💡 Activity 1: Try identifying some activities you’ve done, think about them as projects and analyse how you managed them.\\n\\nWhat is project management?\\n\\nProject management involves the application of general/domain knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to fulfil stated project requirements and achieve a desired set of outcomes/results.\\n\\nIt is highly significant for businesses as it guarantees that all projects meet its expected outcome both within a designated timeframe and defined budget.', 'The fantastic aspect of project management is its broad application across various industries and types of companies, without the need for deep technical/domain knowledge.\\n\\nThis implies that your past job or life experiences can contribute to developing the skills essential for a successful career in project management.\\n\\nAccording to a survey by the Project Management Institute;\\n\\n31% of projects fail to meet an organisation’s goals\\n\\n43% of the projects miss budget targets\\n\\n48% of projects miss delivery dates\\n\\nHence, the success of projects, regardless of their scale; big or small, rests significantly on effective project management.\\n\\nTitle:What is Time Series Forecasting?\\n\\nArticle:\\nWhat is Time Series Forecasting?\\n\\nPhoto by Aron Visuals on Unsplash\\n\\nTime series forecasting, the time dependent area of machine learning and data science.\\n\\nTricky but yet fun to explore.\\n\\nWhat is Time Series?\\n\\nA dataset for machine learning is simply a set of observations.', 'What is Time Series?\\n\\nA dataset for machine learning is simply a set of observations.\\n\\nFor instance;\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms often presume that your data is independent and uniformly distributed, which isn’t the case with time series data.\\n\\nTime series brings order to the observations with respect with time.\\n\\nThis additional dimension serves as a constraint as well as a structure that gives more data.\\n\\nHence, time series is a sequence of observations taken serially in time.\\n\\n— Page 1, Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control.\\n\\nTime Series Nomenclature\\n\\nThe present time is referred to as t, and an observation made at that time is referred to as obs (t).\\n\\nLag times or lags refer to prior time observations.\\n\\nFor example, a prior time is defined as t-1, with obs(t-1) as its observation, and the time before that is specified as t-2, with obs(t-2) as its observation (t-2).\\n\\nThe following are the time observations beyond the present time: t+1 and obs(t+1); t+2 and obs(t+2).', 'The following are the time observations beyond the present time: t+1 and obs(t+1); t+2 and obs(t+2).\\n\\nBelow is a summary;\\n\\n(t-n) → prior time\\n\\n(t) → point of reference\\n\\n(t+n) → future/forecast time\\n\\nA Table of Time Series Observations\\n\\nTimes Series Analysis vs. Times Series Forecasting\\n\\nTime series analysis entails characterizing the dataset, whereas forecasting entails making predictions.\\n\\nThe basic goal of time series analysis is to create mathematical models that provide reasonable descriptions of the dataset, such as meaningful statistics and other properties; forecasting entails utilizing models that have been fitted to historical data to forecast future observations.\\n\\nPredictive modeling can be divided into three (3) categories:\\n\\nData sampling: This involves the collection of data which best describes the problem with known relationships between inputs and outputs.\\n\\nModel training: This involves the use of sampled data to create a model that can be used repeatedly.', 'Model training: This involves the use of sampled data to create a model that can be used repeatedly.\\n\\nPredicting: This involves using the trained model on new data for which the output is unknown.\\n\\nTime Series Analysis vs Forecasting\\n\\nComponents of Time Series\\n\\nTime Series Decomposed Components\\n\\nA given time series can be comprised of systematic and non-systematic components.\\n\\nSystematic components includes: level, trend, and seasonality, while non-systematic component: noise.\\n\\nSystematic components have consistency or repetition which may be modeled and explained whereas non-systematic components cannot directly be modeled.\\n\\nEach of these components can be defined as follows:\\n\\nLevel: Any time series will have a baseline, to which we add different components to form a complete time series.\\n\\nTrend: This is the increasing or decreasing value in the series over time.\\n\\nFor example the above time series has an increasing trend.', 'For example the above time series has an increasing trend.\\n\\nSeasonality: This is the repeating patterns or cycles of behaviour in the series over time.\\n\\nFor example the above time series clearly has seasonality.\\n\\nNoise: This is random variation or fluctuations in the time series data.\\n\\nAll time series have a level, most have noise, and the trend and seasonality are optional.\\n\\nThe above components can be gotten from the decomposition of a given time series.\\n\\nThere are mainly two types of time series decomposition, namely; additive decomposition and multiplicative decomposition.\\n\\nAdditive decomposition is simply the addition of all individual components to get the original time series.\\n\\nFor example the above time series is an additive decomposition.\\n\\ny(t) = Level + Trend + Seasonality + Noise\\n\\nMultiplicative decomposition is simply the multiplication of all individual components to get the original time series.', 'y(t) = Level ×Trend ×Seasonality × Noise\\n\\nTime series forecasting can be found in many areas, below are a few examples:\\n\\nEach year, forecasting the corn yield in tons per state.\\n\\nPredicting the daily closing price of a stock.\\n\\nPredicting the annual birth rate at all of a city’s hospitals.\\n\\nPredicting a store’s product sales in terms of units sold per day.\\n\\nPredicting the daily number of people passing through a train station.\\n\\nEach quarter, predicting unemployment in a state.\\n\\nPredicting server utilization demand hour by hour.\\n\\nEach breeding season, estimating

helps individuals to adapt to the changes effectively.\\n\\nThis also leads a more organised project and reduces chaos when applying a change in the project.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy and When to implement change management?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy: Change is inevitable in any project due to evolving requirements, external factors, or unforeseen circumstances.\\n\\nChange management ensures that these changes are implemented smoothly without negatively impacting project goals, timelines, or team morale.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen: Change management should be integrated from the project’s initiation and continue

management methodology?\\n\\nHaving established that not all projects are the same, there is a need to have a predefined set of methods in place for the successful completion of a project.\\n\\nThis is where project management methodology comes in.\\n\\n\\n\\nProject management methodology is a set of guiding principles, techniques and processes used through a project’s life cycle.\\n\\nIt essentially guides project managers with knowing which framework works best for a given project at hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nProjects could be linear or iterative.\\n\\nLinear projects means a project is executed in a sequential order.\\n\\nExamples are; the construction of a house, Highway, pipeline and tunnels construction, these kind of projects benefits from the use of the Waterfall methodology as its dictates a linear approach in project execution.\\n\\nIt is also referred to as the waterfall cycle because the stages have a distinct progressive flow.', 'It is also referred to as the waterfall cycle because the stages have a distinct progressive flow.\\n\\n\\n\\nIterative projects permits more flexibility and change management.\\n\\nIt follows the repetition of phases thereby allowing parts of the project to be tested out to ensure correctness level is achieved before the final result is delivered.\\n\\nParts of the project can be delivered as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire project to be done.\\n\\nIt is also known as the agile cycle due to its ability to break down activities into short phases that derive value.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther project types are;\\n\\nHybrid\\n\\nIncremental\\n\\nEvolutionary\\n\\nThere several project methodologies and I would briefly discuss the following below, but please refer to the references for more methodologies;\\n\\n\\n\\nWaterfall: In the application of this approach, project managers connect each task to the previous one with a dependency.', 'This means that teams cannot proceed to the next phase of work until they have successfully addressed the tasks at hand.\\n\\nSuch a method encourages collaboration and ensures that the team remains focused on the current task.\\n\\nA project manager might opt for the Waterfall approach under the following circumstances:\\n\\nWhen implementing changes to the project becomes costly once initiated.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the project’s phases are well-defined from the outset.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen there are prerequisite tasks that must be completed before progressing to the next stage.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nAgile: The Agile methodology stands out as one of the widely adopted project management frameworks, even surpassing the popularity of Waterfall.\\n\\nAgile is more than just a set of steps but a mindset.\\n\\nIts focus lies in cultivating an effective and collaborative team that actively seeks regular feedback from the client.\\n\\nAgile, in essence, is a philosophy centered around flexibility, client engagement, and continuous improvement.', 'Projects that are ideally suited for an Agile approach are;\\n\\nThose in which the client possesses a general idea of their requirements but lacks a precise vision or has a set of desired qualities without rigid specifications.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the emphasis is on adaptability and the acceptance of a certain level of uncertainty and risk\\n\\nIn scenarios where flexibility and responsiveness to evolving needs are crucial elements of project success.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn example of an Agile project is building a website.\\n\\nYour team would construct various components of the website in iterative sprints, delivering each part to the client as it is completed.\\n\\nThis enables the launch of the website with fully developed sections, such as the main homepage, ready for public viewing, while other features like the company blog or online appointment booking are continuously developed over time.', 'This iterative delivery model facilitates early feedback from the client, allowing for adjustments along the way and minimising wasted efforts.\\n\\nIt ensures that the website evolves organically, aligning with client preferences and requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nScrum:\\n\\nThis Agile framework prioritises the development, delivery, and long-term support of complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process.\\n\\nSmall, cross-functional teams, guided by a Scrum Master, handle the work, which is segmented into brief Sprints with predefined deliverables.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther project methodology can be found in the References\\n\\n💡 Activity 2: List other project management methodologies\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we were able to establish that not all projects are the same but all project do have a similar life cycle.', 'Moreover, we identified that projects could be linear or iterative and all projects would require a some form of framework(s) used for the successfully completion of the project.\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle:The Effective Project Manager\\nArticle:\\nProject manager core skills\\n\\nAs you progress in your journey as a

Follow 4 min read · Nov 9, 2023 -- Listen Share\\n\\nPhoto by Octavian Dan on Unsplash\\n\\nWhat is a project?\\n\\nIn the realm of project management, a project is defined as a unique venture, characterised by its sets of deliverables and exclusive objectives.\\n\\nThis venture is a defined beginning and an end.', 'This venture is a defined beginning and an end.\\n\\n\\n\\nExamples of projects can be found in your daily lives or even your workplace;\\n\\nGrocery shopping within a defined timeframe\\n\\nPlanning your vacation\\n\\nPlanning a wedding ceremony\\n\\nOrganising a party/event\\n\\nCompletion of a university task\\n\\nPreparation for an examination to get a suitable score\\n\\nThese are just a few examples about a projects in our daily lives.\\n\\n\\n\\n💡 Activity 1: Try identifying some activities you’ve done, think about them as projects and analyse how you managed them.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is project management?\\n\\nProject management involves the application of general/domain knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to fulfil stated project requirements and achieve a desired set of outcomes/results.\\n\\nIt is highly significant for businesses as it guarantees that all projects meet its expected outcome both within a designated timeframe and defined budget.', 'The fantastic aspect of project management is its broad application across various industries and types of companies, without the need for deep technical/domain knowledge.\\n\\nThis implies that your past job or life experiences can contribute to developing the skills essential for a successful career in project management.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to a survey by the Project Management Institute;\\n\\n31% of projects fail to meet an organisation’s goals\\n\\n43% of the projects miss budget targets\\n\\n48% of projects miss delivery dates\\n\\nHence, the success of projects, regardless of their scale; big or small, rests significantly on effective project management.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle:What is Time Series Forecasting?\\nArticle:\\nWhat is Time Series Forecasting?\\n\\nPhoto by Aron Visuals on Unsplash\\n\\nTime series forecasting, the time dependent area of machine learning and data science.\\n\\nTricky but yet fun to explore.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Time Series?\\n\\nA dataset for machine learning is simply a set of observations.', 'What is Time Series?\\n\\nA dataset for machine learning is simply a set of observations.\\n\\nFor instance;\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms often presume that your data is independent and uniformly distributed, which isn’t the case with time series data.\\n\\nTime series brings order to the observations with respect with time.\\n\\nThis additional dimension serves as a constraint as well as a structure that gives more data.\\n\\n\\n\\nHence, time series is a sequence of observations taken serially in time.\\n\\n\\n\\n— Page 1, Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control.\\n\\n\\n\\nTime Series Nomenclature\\n\\nThe present time is referred to as t, and an observation made at that time is referred to as obs (t).\\n\\nLag times or lags refer to prior time observations.\\n\\nFor example, a prior time is defined as t-1, with obs(t-1) as its observation, and the time before that is specified as t-2, with obs(t-2) as its observation (t-2).\\n\\nThe following are the time observations beyond the present time: t+1 and obs(t+1); t+2 and obs(t+2).', 'The following are the time observations beyond the present time: t+1 and obs(t+1); t+2 and obs(t+2).\\n\\nBelow is a summary;\\n\\n(t-n) → prior time\\n\\n(t) → point of reference\\n\\n(t+n) → future/forecast time\\n\\nA Table of Time Series Observations\\n\\nTimes Series Analysis vs. Times Series Forecasting\\n\\nTime series analysis entails characterizing the dataset, whereas forecasting entails making predictions.\\n\\nThe basic goal of time series analysis is to create mathematical models that provide reasonable descriptions of the dataset, such as meaningful statistics and other properties; forecasting entails utilizing models that have been fitted to historical data to forecast future observations.\\n\\n\\n\\nPredictive modeling can be divided into three (3) categories:\\n\\n\\n\\nData sampling: This involves the collection of data which best describes the problem with known relationships between inputs and outputs.\\n\\nModel training: This involves the use of sampled data to create a model that can be used repeatedly.', 'Model training: This involves the use of sampled data to create a model that can be used repeatedly.\\n\\nPredicting: This involves using the trained model on new data for which the output is unknown.\\n\\n\\n\\nTime Series Analysis vs Forecasting\\n\\nComponents of Time Series\\n\\nTime Series Decomposed Components\\n\\nA given time series can be comprised of systematic and non-systematic components.\\n\\nSystematic components includes: level, trend, and seasonality, while non-systematic component: noise.\\n\\nSystematic components have consistency or repetition which may be modeled and explained whereas non-systematic components cannot directly be modeled.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach of these components can be defined as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nLevel: Any time series will have a baseline, to which we add different components to form a complete time series.\\n\\nTrend: This is the increasing or decreasing value in the series over time.\\n\\nFor example the above time series has an increasing trend.\\n\\nSeasonality:', 'For example the above time series has an increasing trend.\\n\\nSeasonality:\\n\\nThis is the repeating patterns or cycles of behaviour in the series over time.\\n\\nFor example the above time series clearly has seasonality.\\n\\nNoise:\\n\\nThis is random variation or fluctuations in the time series data.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll time series have a level, most have noise, and the trend and seasonality are optional.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above components can be gotten from the decomposition of a given time series.\\n\\nThere are mainly two types of time series decomposition, namely; additive decomposition and multiplicative decomposition.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditive decomposition is simply the addition of all individual components to get the original time series.\\n\\nFor example the above time series is an additive decomposition.\\n\\n\\n\\ny(t)\\n\\n= Level + Trend + Seasonality + Noise\\n\\nMultiplicative decomposition is simply the multiplication of all individual components to get the original time series.\\n\\ny(t)\\n\\n= Level ×Trend ×Seasonality ×', '= Level ×Trend ×Seasonality ×\\n\\nNoise\\n\\nTime series forecasting can be found in many areas, below are a few examples:\\n\\nEach year, forecasting the corn yield in tons per state.\\n\\n\\n\\nPredicting the daily closing price of a stock.\\n\\n\\n\\nPredicting the annual birth rate at all of a city’s hospitals.\\n\\n\\n\\nPredicting a store’s product sales in terms of units sold per day.\\n\\n\\n\\nPredicting the daily number of people passing through a train station.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach quarter, predicting unemployment in a

Traditional neural networks cannot do this with high accuracy and for this reason Recurrent neural networks have been developed to address this issue due to the following;\\n\\nUse of sequential information.\\n\\nPresence of memory\\n\\nThe above diagram is a Rolled RNN, where;\\n\\nA is the Rolled neural network\\n\\nis the Rolled neural network xâ\\x82\\x9c is a given input\\n\\nis a given input hâ\\x82\\x9c is the output.\\n\\nis the output. The loop allows information to be passed onto the next step of the network.\\n\\nThe diagram shows the unrolled RNN network', 'The diagram shows the unrolled RNN network\\n\\nThe unrolled RNN is nothing more than multiple copies of the same network, passing information to the next successor. It is because of this chain-like nature of RNN that it can be used for sequential data, a good example of this predicting the next word of a sentence; â\\x80\\x9cThe sky is blueâ\\x80\\x9d, the word predicted is blue.\\n\\nBut what if the context gap between relevant information and point of need is quite large, for example; â\\x80\\x9cDaniel loves apples, it makes him healthy,â\\x80¦..,it is a [â\\x80¦..]â\\x80\\x9d. From the given sentence, the network would depend on the context given in the sentence to make a prediction that the final word will be fruit, based off the previous inputs. But due to this gap, RNNs are unable to learn how to make a connection between the relevant information and the point of need.\\n\\nAs the gap grows, RNN fails\\n\\nRNN Use Case (image by author)\\n\\nLSTM(Long Short Term Memory)', 'As the gap grows, RNN fails\\n\\nRNN Use Case (image by author)\\n\\nLSTM(Long Short Term Memory)\\n\\nThis is a variation of RNN which solves the issue encountered in regular RNN (gap growth). LSTMs generally have three gates namely; input gate, forget gate & output gate. Because of this architecture, LSTM is able to solve the vanishing gradient problem encountered by RNNs which leads to difficulty learning from any given data with each successive iteration and is capable of learning long-term dependencies.\\n\\nTake for example, â\\x80\\x9cDaniel loves apples, it makes him healthy,â\\x80¦..,it is a [â\\x80¦..]â\\x80\\x9d,from the given sentence, the network is able to make a successfully prediction that the final word should be fruit, based off the previous inputs due to the preservation of information.\\n\\nLSTM Use Case (image by author)\\n\\nLSTM can also be used to solve a variety of problems such as;\\n\\nTime series forecasting.\\n\\nSpeech recognition\\n\\nVideo analysis.\\n\\nBidirectional LSTM or BiLSTM', 'Time series forecasting.\\n\\nSpeech recognition\\n\\nVideo analysis.\\n\\nBidirectional LSTM or BiLSTM\\n\\nThis processes the sequence of information in both directions; forward (left to right/past to future) and backwards (right to left/future to past).\\n\\nThis is not backward propagation\\n\\nWith regular LSTM input flow can only be processed in one direction, either forward or backwards but fails to fully preserve the information from both directions, but in bidirectional LSTM both past and future information is preserved due to its ability to learn the relationship between future and past words.

Training and Development: Providing necessary training and resources helps individuals to adapt to the changes effectively. This also leads a more organised project and reduces chaos when applying a change in the project.', 'Why and When to implement change management?\\n\\nWhy: Change is inevitable in any project due to evolving requirements, external factors, or unforeseen circumstances. Change management ensures that these changes are implemented smoothly without negatively impacting project goals, timelines, or team morale.\\n\\nWhen: Change management should be integrated from the projectâ\\x80\\x99s initiation and continue throughout its lifecycle. It is crucial during major project milestones, shifts in project scope, or when adapting to external factors.\\n\\n\\nTitle:Project life cycle\\nArticle:\\nWhat is project management methodology?\\n\\nHaving established that not all projects are the same, there is a need to have a predefined set of methods in place for the successful completion of a project. This is where project management methodology comes in.', 'Project management methodology is a set of guiding principles, techniques and processes used through a projectâ\\x80\\x99s life cycle. It essentially guides project managers with knowing which framework works best for a given project at hand.\\n\\nProjects could be linear or iterative. Linear projects means a project is executed in a sequential order. Examples are; the construction of a house, Highway, pipeline and tunnels construction, these kind of projects benefits from the use of the Waterfall methodology as its dictates a linear approach in project execution. It is also referred to as the waterfall cycle because the stages have a distinct progressive flow.', 'Iterative projects permits more flexibility and change management. It follows the repetition of phases thereby allowing parts of the project to be tested out to ensure correctness level is achieved before the final result is delivered. Parts of the project can be delivered as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire project to be done. It is also known as the agile cycle due to its ability to break down activities into short phases that derive value.\\n\\nOther project types are;\\n\\nHybrid\\n\\nIncremental\\n\\nEvolutionary\\n\\nThere several project methodologies and I would briefly discuss the following below, but please refer to the references for more methodologies;', 'Waterfall: In the application of this approach, project managers connect each task to the previous one with a dependency. This means that teams cannot proceed to the next phase of work until they have successfully addressed the tasks at hand. Such a method encourages collaboration and ensures that the team remains focused on the current task. A project manager might opt for the Waterfall approach under the following circumstances:\\n\\nWhen implementing changes to the project becomes costly once initiated.\\n\\nWhen the projectâ\\x80\\x99s phases are well-defined from the outset.\\n\\nWhen there are prerequisite tasks that must be completed before progressing to the next stage.', 'When there are prerequisite tasks that must be completed before progressing to the next stage.\\n\\n2. Agile: The Agile methodology stands out as one of the widely adopted project management frameworks, even surpassing the popularity of Waterfall. Agile is more than just a set of steps but a mindset. Its focus lies in cultivating an effective and collaborative team that actively seeks regular feedback from the client. Agile, in essence, is a philosophy centered around flexibility, client engagement, and continuous improvement. Projects that are ideally suited for an Agile approach are;\\n\\nThose in which the client possesses a general idea of their requirements but lacks a precise vision or has a set of desired qualities without rigid specifications.\\n\\nWhen the emphasis is on adaptability and the acceptance of a certain level of uncertainty and risk\\n\\nIn scenarios where flexibility and responsiveness to evolving needs are crucial elements of project success.', 'An example of an Agile project is building a website. Your team would construct various components of the website in iterative sprints, delivering each part to the client as it is completed. This enables the launch of the website with fully developed sections, such as the main homepage, ready for public viewing, while other features like the company blog or online appointment booking are continuously developed over time. This iterative delivery model facilitates early feedback from the client, allowing for adjustments along the way and minimising wasted efforts. It ensures that the website evolves organically, aligning with client preferences and requirements.', '3. Scrum: This Agile framework prioritises the development, delivery, and long-term support of complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Small, cross-functional teams, guided by a Scrum Master, handle the work, which is segmented into brief Sprints with predefined deliverables.\\n\\nOther project methodology can be found in the References\\n\\nð\\x9f\\x92¡ Activity 2: List other project management methodologies\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we were able to establish that not all projects are the same but all project do have a similar life cycle.

The basic goal of time series analysis is to create mathematical models that provide reasonable descriptions of the dataset, such as meaningful statistics and other properties; forecasting entails utilizing models that have been fitted to historical data to forecast future observations.\\n\\nPredictive modeling can be divided into three (3) categories:\\n\\nData sampling: This involves the collection of data which best describes the problem with known relationships between inputs and outputs. Model training: This involves the use of sampled data to create a model that can be used repeatedly.

Systematic components includes: level, trend, and seasonality, while non-systematic component: noise. Systematic components have consistency or repetition which may be modeled and explained whereas non-systematic components cannot directly be modeled.\\n\\nEach of these components can be defined as follows:\\n\\nLevel: Any time series will have a baseline, to which we add different components to form a complete time series. Trend: This is the increasing or decreasing value in the series over time. For example the above time series has an increasing trend. Seasonality: This is the repeating patterns or cycles of behaviour in the series over time. For example the above time series clearly has seasonality. Noise: This is random variation or fluctuations in the time series data.', 'All time series have a level, most have noise, and the trend and seasonality are optional.\\n\\nThe above components can be gotten from the decomposition of a given time series. There are mainly two types of time series decomposition, namely; additive decomposition and multiplicative decomposition.\\n\\nAdditive decomposition is simply the addition of all individual components to get the original time series.

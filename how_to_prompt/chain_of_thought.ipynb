    "Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT) is a technique developed to encourage large language models to explain their reasoning process, leading to more accurate results. By providing few-shot exemplars demonstrating the reasoning process, the LLM is guided to explain its reasoning when answering the prompt. This approach has been found effective in improving results on tasks like arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning.\n",

You can also support organizations that work to promote transparency and accountability in government, and vote for candidates who have a strong record of ethical behavior and a commitment to serving the public interest. Additionally, you can advocate for stronger laws and regulations to prevent corruption and embezzlement in government.\n"
